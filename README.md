# 9651 Robotics Website
The (in development) website for the 9651 Robotics Team.

The [old code](https://github.com/9651-Robotics/website-old) is frankly poorly coded and designed: we're planning on reworking the site, when the club heads/designers have time. We'll be condensing the website, reducing clutter, and fixing many bad coding practices. Until then, we don't suggest adding new features on this broken code. In addition, content won't be fully up to date as we figure out the changes we're making. Thanks for being patient!
